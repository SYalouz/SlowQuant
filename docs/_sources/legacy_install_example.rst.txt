
Installation and running
========================

Installation
------------

This part assume that the non-legacy version of SlowQuant is working.

The additional python packages can now be installed by:

::
  
  conda install cython

The gcc compiler can be installed by:

::
  
  sudo apt-get install gcc

Inside the SlowQuant folder run:

::
  
  python setup_legacy.py build_ext --inplace

To test the installation install run:

::
  
  pytest tests_legacy.py

All of the tests should succeed.

The legacy code of the program is run as:

::
  
  python SlowQuant_legacy.py MOLECULE SETTINGS
  
See test files for examples of input files, or read "Example input files" under "Legacy documentation"

As it can bee seen the one with DIIS converges in 10 iterations, whereas without DIIS it never converges

Hartee-Fock H2 dissociation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the Hartree-Fock approximation the dissociation of dihydrogen can be considered. To investigate this the following geometry input was used:

::

  2;;; 
  1;0.0;0.0;0.0
  1;x;0.0;0.0

Here x is varied to make the dissociation curve. The following settings were used:

::
  
  Initial method;HF
  basisset;3-21G

and,

::
  
  Initial method;UHF
  basisset;3-21G

For x varried from 0.5 to 13 a.u. the following curve can be made:

.. image:: _static/H2dissociation.png

For a script to calculate the curves see SlowQuant/data/notebooks/H2_dissociation_HF_vs_UHF_legacy.ipynb

It can be seen from the curve that (R)HF and UHF converges to two different values. By calculating H- and H radical it can be seen that RHF converges to H- and H+, whereas UHF converges towards 2x H radicals.
This can be understood since RHF is a closed-shell method. When H2 dissociates it is expected that each hydrogen will be associated with one electron, this cannot be described with RHF. UHF can describe open-shells and therefore, seem to have a better description of the dissociation.
UHF have other problems like spin contamination to be aware of.

Issues
------

In this section known problems with the code can be found

General
~~~~~~~

- No checking of input files at all at any stages of the code
- Basisset object has a bad structure
- Loops should be replaced with np.einsum() in many cases
- Documentation of integral code is out-of-date

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

- A lot of recalculations in R, when calculating higher order angular momentum integrals
- Not sure variables are passed around in integral code the right way with respect to Cython
- The SCF seem to have trouble converging if BOMD time steps are above 1.0 a.u.
- All information is stored directly in memory; Integrals scale as N^4 for memory

Need testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- DCPT2 not tested, no case in paper, where cartesian integrals was used (all had D orbitals)

Broken
~~~~~~

- Self overlap integrals is non-one for contracted  basisfunctions
- No check for singularity in DIIS, H2/STO3G breaks the code if used with DIIS
- Changing Cython directive_defaults seem to make the code break sometimes, not very reproduceable
