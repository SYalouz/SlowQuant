# SlowQuant

![SlowQuant logo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11976167/26658726/5e125b02-466c-11e7-8790-8412789fc9fb.jpg)

SlowQuant is a molecular quantum chemistry program written in python. Even the computational demanding parts are written in python, so it lacks speed, thus the name SlowQuant. The program is run from HFrun.py by specifing an input file and a settings file in the buttom of the script.

### Input file:

The input file have the following format:

-----------------------------------------

10;;;

1;1.63803684;1.136548823;0

8;0;-0.143225817;0

1;-1.63803684;1.136548823;0

-----------------------------------------

The first number is the number of electrons (have to be even since the program is only for closed shell). 

The first coloum is the atom given as number in the periodic system.

The three next coloums is the coordinates in a.u. (bohr).


### Setting file:

The setting file have the following format:

-----------------------------------------

basisset;STO3G

MPn;MP2

-----------------------------------------

When a calculation is run, first the Standardsettings.csv is loaded in. The user given settings file will then overrule the specified settings. The above file will make a calculation using the basisset STO3G. It will perform a MP2 calculation.
## Features:

As of now the program have the following features and settings.

### Requirements:

Python 3.4 or above (might work for lower versions)

Numpy

Scipy
