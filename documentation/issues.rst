- Code in general is a gigantic mess
- Numerical methods, makes code none module like
- No checking of input files at all at any stages of the code

Need testing
------------

- Contracted derivatives is not properly normalized, geometry optimization might not work properly
- No tests for normalization of contracted basisfunctions of D or higher angular momentum

Broken
------

- None known
